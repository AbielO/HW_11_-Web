            <p>Microsoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets,[7] using a grid of cells arranged in
                numbered rows and letter-named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It
                has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering and financial needs. In
                addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts, and with a very limited
                three-dimensional graphical display. It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on
                various factors for different perspectives (using pivot tables and the scenario manager).[8] It has
                a programming aspect, Visual Basic for Applications, allowing the user to employ a wide variety of
                numerical methods, for example, for solving differential equations of mathematical physics,[9][10]
                and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet.It also has a variety of interactive
                features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user, so the
                spreadsheet presents itself as a so-called application, or decision support system (DSS), via a
                custom-designed user interface, for example, a stock analyzer,[11] or in general, as a design tool
                that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports.[12][13][14] </p>

            <p> In a more elaborate
                realization, an Excel application can automatically poll external databases and measuring
                instruments using an update schedule,[15] analyze the results, make a Word report or PowerPoint
                slide show, and e-mail these presentations on a regular basis to a list of participants. Excel was
                not designed to be used as a database.[citation needed]

                Microsoft allows for a number of optional command-line switches to control the manner in which Excel
                starts</p>

                <p>VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications. It is a combination of the Microsoft's event-driven programming language Visual Basic with Microsoft Office Applications such as Microsoft Excel.

                        VBA enables you to automate various activities in Excel like generating reports, preparing charts & graphs, doing calculations, etc. This automation activity is also often referred as Macro. This way it helps users to save their time spent behind running the repetitive steps. </p>

                <p> The Office suite of applications has a rich set of features. There are many different ways to author, format, and manipulate documents, email, databases, forms, spreadsheets, and presentations. The great power of VBA programming in Office is that nearly every operation that you can perform with a mouse, keyboard, or a dialog box can also be done by using VBA. Further, if it can be done once with VBA, it can be done just as easily a hundred times. (In fact, the automation of repetitive tasks is one of the most common uses of VBA in Office.)</p>
