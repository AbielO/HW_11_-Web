                <p>In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for
                    data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for
                    manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause
                    BSD license.[2] The name is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets
                    that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals. Developer Wes
                    McKinney started working on pandas in 2008 while at AQR Capital Management out of the
                    need for a high performance, flexible tool to perform quantitative analysis on financial data.
                    Before leaving AQR he was able to convince management to allow him to open source the library.

                    Another AQR employee, Chang She, joined the effort in 2012 as the second major contributor to the
                    library.

                    In 2015, pandas signed on as a fiscally sponsored project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity
                    in the United States </p>

            <p>Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics
                extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using
                general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab"
                interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though
                its use is discouraged.[3] SciPy makes use of Matplotlib.

                Matplotlib was originally written by John D. Hunter, has an active development community,[4] and is
                distributed under a BSD-style license. Michael Droettboom was nominated as matplotlib's lead developer
                shortly before John Hunter's death in August 2012,[5] and further joined by Thomas Caswell.[6][7]

            <p>As of 23 June 2017, matplotlib 2.0.x supports Python versions 2.7 through 3.6. Matplotlib 1.2 is the
                first version of matplotlib to support Python 3.x. Matplotlib 1.4 is the last version of Matplotlib to
                support Python 2.6.[8]

                Matplotlib has pledged to not support Python 2 past 2020 by signing the Python 3 Statement.</p>
